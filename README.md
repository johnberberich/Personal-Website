My personal website.

Goals:
- For every directory, all non-index.html files will also be accessible through a subdirectory named after the file and containing a index.html file with the same content.  For instance, for the about.html file, we will also generate /about/index.html.

Dependencies:
- Jinja2, for templating
- Werkzeug, for routing in dynamic mode

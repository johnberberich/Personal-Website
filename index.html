      I began programming when I realized I could create my own games (the first was a top-down maze on my TI-82), and after learning Pascal in high school, I wanted a career writing software.
  </p>
  <p>
      I've been able to contribute to a wide variety of interesting projects in a diverse set of industries. The latest had me learning PHP and Symfony 2 on the fly to create a report-building site from the groud up. Prior to that, my focus was on C# and the Microsoft .NET web stack, working on one-off ASP.NET apps to Internet sites running on SharePoint.

      At home, I'm rather fond of Python and use it on my side projects, and I still maintain an interest in game development, particularly in HTML5 and canvas.

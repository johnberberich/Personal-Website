<h1>I started programming when I realized I could make my own games...</h1>
<p>
    ...my first was a top-down maze crawler for the TI-82. After learning Pascal in my high school's Computer Science classes, I knew I wanted to write software for a living.

    During the past ten years, I've worked on a wide variety of interesting projects for a diverse set of companies. My last project had me learning PHP and Symfony 2 while I created a reporting site from scratch for an education non-profit. Before that, my focus was on C# and the .NET web stack, working on one-off ASP.NET apps to Internet sites running on SharePoint.

    At home, I'm rather fond of Python and use it on my side projects, and I still maintain an interest in game development, particularly in HTML5 and canvas.
